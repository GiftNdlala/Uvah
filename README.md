# üõ∞Ô∏è Uvah? ‚Äî ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù

A GPS-based **friends & family safety + social location app** designed for South African communities.
Simple, township-friendly, and built to answer one question: **Uvah? (Where are you?)**

---

## üöÄ Vision
Uvah? is an **independent location-sharing and safety app** for everyday South Africans.
It is **not** tied to community patrol structures ‚Äî instead, it‚Äôs about:

* Staying connected with **friends and family**
* **Lightweight safety features** that work even on low-end devices
* Township-friendly UX (data-lite, easy to use, local slang branding)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Current MVP (Live in Codebase)

#### 1. **Backend**
- **Django REST API** for alerts and live location tracking
- **Alert Model:** severity, status, trigger source, live view token
- **AlertLocation Model:** latitude, longitude, accuracy, timestamp
- **API Endpoints:**
  - Create alert (`/api/alerts`)
    - Add location to alert (`/api/alerts/<id>/locations`)
      - Get alert details + latest location (`/api/alerts/<id>`)
        - Live location polling (`/api/live/<token>/latest`)
        - **Live Map Webpage:** Real-time location for an alert (Leaflet.js)
        - **Admin Panel:** Manage alerts and locations
        - **Database:** SQLite (Postgres planned)

        #### 2. **Mobile App**
        - **React Native App** (`App.js`)
        - **SOS Flow:** Start SOS, create alert, send location updates
        - **Share Link:** Live tracking link for WhatsApp/SMS
        - **UI:** Simple, check-in and SOS features

        #### 3. **Dev Setup**
        - **Dockerfile** for backend API
        - **docker-compose.yml** (referenced, not fully implemented)

        ---

        ### Planned Features & Transition Roadmap

        #### Backend Services (Planned)

        - **User & Contacts Service:** Profiles, friend requests, groups, emergency contacts
        - **Location Service:** Last-known location, live streaming, location history
        - **Notification Service:** Push (FCM/APNs), SMS fallback, in-app alerts
        - **SOS / Alerts Service:** Panic button event pipeline, broadcast, escalation
        - **Analytics Service:** Anonymized stats, no long-term personal location storage

        #### Data Layer (Planned)
        - **PostgreSQL** ‚Äî relational DB for users, groups, consents
        - **Redis** ‚Äî live location cache, session store, rate limits
        - **S3 / MinIO** ‚Äî profile pictures and media attachments

        #### Infrastructure (Planned)
        - **API Gateway:** FastAPI or Node.js REST + WebSocket endpoints
        - **Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes
        - **Message Queue:** RabbitMQ or Kafka
        - **Hosting:** Cloud-agnostic

        #### Security & Privacy (Planned)
        - End-to-end TLS encryption
        - Granular consent for location sharing
        - Panic SOS bypasses privacy filters
